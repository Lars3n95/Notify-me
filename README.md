Translation files for the Android App [Notify me - Notification](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.kila.addnotification.lars)

If you want to translate the App Notify me, this repository is the right place. Just add a new folder with the language abbreviation **ISO 639-1** (here is a [list](https://www.loc.gov/standards/iso639-2/php/code_list.php))  and translate all the words/texts you can find in the other strings.xml files (e.g. in /values/strings.xml).

With uploading your translations you are giving me all the rights to use/modify/delete them. If you want to remove your translations write me an email.

## How does this work?

#### What you have to do
1. Create a GitHub account
2. Go to https://github.com/Lars3n95/Notify-me/
3. Click 'Create new file'
4. Name of your file: values-abbreviation/strings.xml (example: values-es/strings.xml for spanish translation)
5. Insert the content of values/strings.xml 
6. Translate all the content
   The xml is structure like this: `<string name="key">Value</string>`
   You only have to translate the "Value".

7. Add a title and description at the bottom of the page if you like or need to
8. "Propose new file"
9. "Create pull request"
10. Write a comment if you like or need to
11. "Create pull request"

#### What I have to do
13. I will take a look at your translation and merge it with the project if everything is fine
14. I will add you to the Contributors list (tell me if you dont want that)
15. I will add your translation in the next "Notify me" App update so that you can use your translation
