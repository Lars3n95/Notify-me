Translation files for the Android App [Notify me - Notification](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.kila.addnotification.lars)

If you want to translate the App Notify me, this repository is the right place. Just add a new folder with the language abbreviation **ISO 639-1** (here is a [list](https://www.loc.gov/standards/iso639-2/php/code_list.php))  and translate all the words/texts you can find in the other strings.xml files (e.g. in /values/strings.xml).

With uploading your translations you are giving me all the rights to use/modify/delete them. If you want to remove your translations write me an email.
